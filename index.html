          <p class="hero-sub">Talent is everywhere, but opportunity isn't. In the villages of Tamil Nadu, bright high school students are being left behind in the digital age. The Compute Initiative's primary objective is to address this gap. We bring technology access directly into their hands and connect them with mentors who can guide them. It’s about more than skills—it’s about showing these students they have the power to create, dream bigger, and open doors they never knew existed. Our mission is to make the benefits of the digital age accessible to those without daily access, fostering personal empowerment and preparing them for future career opportunities.</p>

          <h1>About The First Compute Initiative: SRM Arunachalam Higher Secondary School, Panayapatti </h1>
          <p>
The Compute Institute (TCi) has partnered with a government-aided SRM Arunachalam Higher Secondary School in Panayapatti (Pudukottai District) to empower rural young students by introducing Computer Science as a standard subject for grades 6 through 10. TCi will donate computers and provide ongoing support with a dedicated curriculum and teaching staff, enabling students to develop essential skills in modern technology, including responsible AI learning through strong collaboration with local volunteers and educators.
